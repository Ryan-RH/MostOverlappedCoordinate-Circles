This code was created to find the most overlapped point of a finite number of circles with fixed radii.
The task was initially taken on using a brute-force method of scanning every coordinate point within the area with a specified step size and seeing how many circles overlap that point.
However, this method proved to be inaccurate and incredibly computationally inefficient.

This code managed to decrease the time taken to find the most overlapped point by 99.95% with 100% accuracy for the given data.

It can be adapted for circles with random radii very easily.
